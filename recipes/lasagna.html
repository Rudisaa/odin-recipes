                <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large cast iron skillet. Once hot, add the diced onions and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
                <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet, and brown. Once beef has cooked through, drain the fat, then stir in the all spice (or seven spices), salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Add the diced tomatoes, and tomato sauce and mix to combine. Stir in the basil, oregano, salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Add the evaporated milk- anywhere between 1/2 can to a full can depending on how creamy you want the sauce. Stir again.</li>
                <li>Break the lasagna noodles over the skillet into the sauce.  Press the noodles down into the sauce to cover them as much as possible. Cover the skillet with a lid, and simmer on medium for 15-20 minutes until noodles have cooked through. Preheat the oven to 350 F (180C) while noodles are simmering.</li>
                <li>Add a handful of mozzarella cheese and stir to combine, Top the lasagna with the rest of the shredded mozzarella cheese. If you like, place the skillet in the oven for a few minutes on broil to get the top golden brown and bubbly. Enjoy!</li>
